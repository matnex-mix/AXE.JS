when you open the axe-easy.js you will see something like

/*
	
	See all axe-easy default animations, copy this to a javascript console

**
	console.log( JSON.parse( atob( 'eyJib3VuY2UiOnsiYSI6IkFUMCUgdDogdFktLTEwMCU7IG86IDA7IEFUNSUgdDogdFktLTEwMCUgbzogMDsgQVQxNSUgdDogdFktMDsgcEI6IDU\

this is not meant to be editted, it is the default animations that come with axe-easy. It is a way to revert axe-easy back to the default animations when you seem lost.

If you are familiar with javascript, you will see a variable named $xeasy was declared. This declaration is an object and it contains all the axe-easy animations.

Adding your animation
you just extend the $xeasy object one element like thus

	$xeasy[extension-name] = extension-options

	extension-name: name to reference the animation
	extension-options: same as animation options with an extra optional property (ini)
	ini (property of extension-options): a function that gets executed after the animation has been created and takes in an argument referencing the created animation

		$xeasy['mybounce'] = {
			a: "AT0% t: tY--100%; o: 0; AT5% t: tY--100% o: 0; AT15% t: tY-0; pB: 5; AT30% t: tY--50%; AT40% t: tY-0; pB: 6; AT50% t: tY--30%; AT70% t: tY-0; pB: 7px; AT80% t: tY--15%; AT90% t: tY-0; pb: 7; AT95% t: tY--7%; AT97% t: tY-0; pB: 9; AT99% t: tY--3%; AT100% t: tY-0; pB: 9;",
			n: "bounce",
			t: 3,
			f: "ease-out",
			ini: function( anim ){
				console.log( anim.name )
			}
		}
